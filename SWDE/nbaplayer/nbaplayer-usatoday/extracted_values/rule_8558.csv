"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0097.htm","He'll be relevant again, but will be worked back into the mix slowly. And once Josh Howard makes his season debut, Thorntons' value should disappear."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0267.htm","He'd been out with an ankle injury, not that it matters in fantasyland. There's also no guarantees that he plays."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0143.htm",Bell's absence was not a distraction and had nothing to do with the Bucks' season-ending loss. He'll return next season as a bit player off the bench.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0101.htm","He played 40 minutes, which is great news, but he still doesn't look fully healthy or comfortable. Keep him in your lineup until further notice."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0154.htm","Go ahead and get him into your lineups, but if you have better options the flu could be used as a tie-breaker between him and another player."

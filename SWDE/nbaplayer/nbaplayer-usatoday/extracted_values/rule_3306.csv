"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0220.htm",Allen will be fine to play his defensive stopper role for the start of the season. He'll need injuries in front of him to be a fantasy factor.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0340.htm",Ross isn't really part of New Jersey's rotation so it's hard to know where the injury ends and the DNP-CD begins.

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0194.htm","He's a starter in name only, and this is a good measure of what to expect in terms of playing time, and needless to say he is not a fantasy option."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0130.htm",Billups doesn't need to risk aggravating any of his injuries at practice. He'll be ready for his usual 31-34 minutes.

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0143.htm",Bell's absence was not a distraction and had nothing to do with the Bucks' season-ending loss. He'll return next season as a bit player off the bench.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0101.htm","He played 40 minutes, which is great news, but he still doesn't look fully healthy or comfortable. Keep him in your lineup until further notice."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0114.htm","Frankly, we're surprised he produced this much. He is the starter in name only and should not be paid attention to in fantasy leagues."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0097.htm","He'll be relevant again, but will be worked back into the mix slowly. And once Josh Howard makes his season debut, Thorntons' value should disappear."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0256.htm","West missed Friday's game due to illness, but is apparently feeling better after using the day between games to rest."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0220.htm",Allen will be fine to play his defensive stopper role for the start of the season. He'll need injuries in front of him to be a fantasy factor.

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0130.htm",Billups doesn't need to risk aggravating any of his injuries at practice. He'll be ready for his usual 31-34 minutes.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0247.htm","Fisher was a borderline PG option in fantasy leagues last season, and as long as Blake is around he's probably not worth owning."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0076.htm","That gets their roster down to 15. Skinner wasn't needed because the Bucks are very deep, albeit undersized, on the front line."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0003.htm","Being that it's merely soreness (as of right now), the injury doesn't sound serious. Consider him day-to-day."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0283.htm",He is averaging under three points per game this season and is not worth fantasy consideration.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0309.htm","Elson's minutes have been fairly regular, but he doesn't offer fantasy value and his long-term outlook is bleak with Mehmet Okur returning eventually."

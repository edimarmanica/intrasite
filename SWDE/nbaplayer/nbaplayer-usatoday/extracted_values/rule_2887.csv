"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0315.htm","This could be bad news for Sundiata Gaines or Ronnie Price, as Watson could end up as the primary back up for Deron Williams."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0386.htm",He's been struggling lately and we'd probably look for a safer option in weekly leagues - especially coming off the injury.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0312.htm","Miles was the only one we were too worried about, but he looks like a go, along with the two stars."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0412.htm","He says he doesn't like wearing them, but given the fact he's averaging eight minutes per game, we think he'll be OK."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0016.htm","He will not have any value this year unless Noah were to go down with a serious injury, and should be avoided on draft day."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0070.htm",The Raptors' sharp-shooter is day-to-day but his fantasy prospects have dimmed with the emergence of rookie Ed Davis off the bench.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0041.htm",Jones doesn't shoot the 3-ball so he doesn't fit with coach Jim O'Brien. He's behind James Posey and Paul George on the depth chart.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0227.htm",Get him in your lineups for the upcoming week. D.J. White is also available after an ankle sprain forced him to make an early exit from Friday's game.

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0226.htm","White was just send down yesterday, but Nenad Krstic's sudden knee issue means White is back. He'll be insurance."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0410.htm","And this was without Dwyane Wade and LeBron James. Anthony is a starting center in name only, and should generally be avoided in fantasy leagues."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0390.htm","He should see some playing time at shooting guard, where Wilson Chandler and Bill Walker are expected to battle it out for the starting job."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0165.htm","There haven't been any updates on his status, and he doesn't have any fantasy value, but his absence has opened up minutes for Darko Milicic."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0407.htm","Unless Jermaine O'Neal goes down with an injury (or should we say 'until'), Magloire is not going to have value. He played just 18 minutes tonight."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0382.htm",Williams could be working his way into the rotation as Toney Douglas continues to struggle. Just keep an eye on him.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0416.htm","Jones took a hard fall in Tuesday, but owners in daily leagues should feel free to activate the three-point specialist for Thursday night."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0056.htm","This moves J.J. Redick back to the bench, and Carter is supposed to be free of any minute count. We'll see how they do."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0310.htm","Evans is doubtful to play on Friday, which makes sense considering he's injured his shooting wrist and was already playing a small role off the bench."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0087.htm",This is why we're skeptical about believing RealGM reports in the first place. Boykins in Atlanta would have made no sense whatsoever.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0325.htm","fine, even if he said in pre-game that he'll be seeing a doctor about them Tuesday, adding that he's been dealing with them since college."

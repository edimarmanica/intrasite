"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0292.htm","With Tiago Splitter (18 points) starting to make his mark, Bonner is little more than a desperation 3-point specialist. You can do better."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0076.htm","Skinner did okay, with eight rebounds and four blocks to go with two points, but he's clearly not a fantasy option buried at the end of the bench."

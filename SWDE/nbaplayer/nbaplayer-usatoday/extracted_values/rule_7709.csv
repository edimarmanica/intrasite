"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0237.htm","By the time Ratliff gets back, Andrew Bynum (knee) should be in midseason form. That will leave Ratliff, 37, inactive on most nights."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0363.htm","As expected, the production from Saturday was a mirage, and owners who picked him up on a flier should not hesitate to drop him for a hot free agent."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0372.htm","He has no fantasy value and the impact his absence has had on the rotation is minimal, at best."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0340.htm","He's day-to-day, but we're surprised he was in the game long enough to actually suffer an injury."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0335.htm","They recently cut Sean May, giving Smith a chance of making the team. The journeyman shouldn't be worth owning in fantasy leagues this year."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0064.htm","The team and Evans are exploring what the best course of treatment should be, although no timetable has been announced yet."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0270.htm",It's not serious and it sounds like he'll play on Tuesday against the Hornets.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0226.htm",White's fractured thumb is apparently good to go. He's a long shot for significant minutes with the Thunder.

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0392.htm",The Pistons have decent frontcourt depth and Wilcox's absence basically passes unnoticed for fantasy purposes. He remains day-to-day.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0186.htm","Wilkins gives the Timberwolves some added defense and depth, but he's not a fantasy asset."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0286.htm","While it's a nice story for Childress that he had his best game as a Sun in his return to Atlanta, he remains largely useless to fantasy owners."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0073.htm","Sanders is coming off of his near triple-double on Wednesday, and he's worth a look in a spot start here. As for Bogut, get him into your lineup."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0243.htm","He's better than Derek Fisher, but is not a great fantasy option. Just keep your eye on him, as he could become a nice source of threes down the road."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0058.htm","The Raps have lost six straight, but it was nice to see Bargnani bounce back from a few bad games, while the nine boards tied a season high."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0219.htm","Vasquez is back with the team and shooting jump shots, so he's close. But he's clearly fallen behind Acie Law for backup point guard duties."

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0347.htm","It's possible Varejao starts posting this line on a full-time basis, so hang in there with him. His rib injury didn't appear to bother him tonight."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0187.htm",He could start for the next month or so and is worth a look in most leagues. Jordan Crawford didn't even get off the bench tonight.
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0106.htm","He's probably in the doghouse, and with Tyson Chandler playing out of his mind right now there's no real reason to own Haywood."

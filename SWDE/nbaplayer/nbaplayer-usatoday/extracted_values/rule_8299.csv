"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0324.htm",Someone had to go to make room for Zydrunas Ilgauskus and Jackson makes sense. The D-Leaguer could be headed back to the Erie Bayhawks.

"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0041.htm","The Jones boys aren't going to bring a lot in return, but then again, the Pacers probably aren't asking for much."
"/media/edimar/SAMSUNG/doutorado04/bases/SWDE/nbaplayer/nbaplayer-usatoday/0363.htm","As expected, the production from Saturday was a mirage, and owners who picked him up on a flier should not hesitate to drop him for a hot free agent."

"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_battlestationsmidway.html",It’s a mix of exciting and overwhelming as you try to maintain what feels like 50 pots boiling over at different times.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_topspin2.html",A decent sequel to the first game that is ultimately mired by an intolerably imbalanced career mode.

"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_projectsylpheed.html","Too much plot, not enough variety and not nearly enough action. Shame."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_kaneandlynchdeadmen.html","Kane & Lynch is a good idea that is plagued by poor controls, unbalanced weapons, a boring story and some questionable writing."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_blacksitearea51.html","Blacksite's biggest issues aren't in the controls, but the lack of what you can do with them, not to mention the horrible enemy A.I."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_rumblerosesxx.html",And that is perhaps this game's only saving grace: it is one damn fine looking game. Both arenas and the ladies are visualized exceptionally well.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_segasuperstarstennis.html","The game is even fun at first, until you hit the curse of repetitive gameplay and inconsistent AI, which is where it all falls apart."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_startreklegacy.html","The game has some fun moments, but as a longtime 'Trek' fan, this isn't the breathtaking legacy I was hoping for."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_spidermanfriendorfoe.html","Itâ€™s a shame that the game is essentially killed by its lack of depth, because if it had some, this would be a worthwhile game."

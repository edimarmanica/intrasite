"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_bigs.html",A little simplistic but somehow that's what makes this a great game.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/psx_alienresurrection.html","It literally scared the ""sh.t"" out of me. Truly the best (and most horrifying) game I have played since Resident Evil. Highly recommended!"

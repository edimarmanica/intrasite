"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_enemyterritoryquakewars.html","Finally, the move to the consoles should make this game available to many more people, but it costs twice as much as it does for PC and isn't as good."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_guitarheroaerosmith.html",It's tough to get excited about Guitar Hero: Aerosmith. It's essentially a re-release of Guitar Hero III with a new song list and some new avatars.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_sceneitlightscameraaction.html","Plain and simple, “Scene It? Lights, Camera, Action” is a great party game for the Xbox 360."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_timeshift.html",TimeShift would be a pretty average game if it wasn't for the time manipulating abilities.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_tonyhawksamericanwasteland.html",An excellent skating game despite the fact that there’s very little that distinguishes this from the other console versions.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_amped3.html",The lack of genuine Live play does hurt the longevity of the game but I guess you cant have everything.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_fifa07.html",A solid effort. The one-on-one shooter vs. goalie during loading screens is enough fun to warrant this one a rental all by itself.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_puzzlequestchallengeofthewarlords.html",A game that grabs you and doesn’t let go. It is one of the most addicting arcade games that I have ever played.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_conan.html","Conan may at times be awkward and slightly derivative, but when compared to the fun that is available within, these shortcomings pale in comparison."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_emenchantarm.html","I also found it strange that wherever Atsuma went there was always a cloud of dust at his feet. Not sure why this bothered me, but it did."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_infiniteundiscovery.html","I ended up enjoying Infinite Undiscovery quite a bit. It's not the best that Tri-Ace has created, but it's a pretty solid outing for these guys."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_dragonballzburstlimit.html",This is the best and best looking Dragon Ball Z game that has been made. Every fan should buy this game.

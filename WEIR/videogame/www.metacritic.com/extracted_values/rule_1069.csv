"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_beowulf.html","It's just run-of-the-mill game design. Bar the occasionally impressive combat, Beowulf doesn't have enough to make it stand out."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_darkmessiahofmightandmagicelements.html","This not a good game. It's not an outright right failure either, but with limited gaming funds and time I suggest giving this title a wide berth."

"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/psx_castlevaniachronicles.html",It's certainly a graphical step down from the usual PSX fare - for that matter it's a graphical step down from the NES.

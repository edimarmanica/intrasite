"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_tenchuz.html","Surprisingly, Tenchu Z comes off “chunky” in general; the antithesis of what a ninja game should feel like- sleek and efficient."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_fifasoccer06.html",This is not a bad game but it does feel like you are getting a lot less of the game for a higher retail price compared with the Xbox version.

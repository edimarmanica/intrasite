"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_beowulf.html","It's just run-of-the-mill game design. Bar the occasionally impressive combat, Beowulf doesn't have enough to make it stand out."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_boogiebunnies.html","Boogie Bunnies isn't so much bad as it is unimaginative, derivative, and just plain boring."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_warhammerbattlemarch.html","Only the most experienced real-time strategy players will be able to make sense of it, much less enjoy it."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_spectralforce3.html","Spectral Force 3 is a throwback to older days from the genre, but feels a bit too antiquated and uninteresting to be recommendable."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/psx_worldsscariestpolicechases.html","Nothing but a knock-off of every other mission-based car game out there, and a dull and frustrating one at that."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_brainchallenge.html","Despite its flaws, many of which are correctable with a patch, it does an admirable job of sharpening your mind in an entertaining fashion."

"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_battlezone.html","In conclusion, Battlezone joins that ragged band of Xbox Live Arcade titles that, even for a mere 400 points, donâ€™t deserve to grace your hard drive."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_incrediblehulk2008.html",Edge of Reality seems to simply not have had enough time or money to do anything original with The Incredible Hulk.
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_samuraiwarriors2.html","The gameplay really needs an upgrade before I can recommend this series again. [Nov. 2006, p.130]"
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_tetrissplash.html","Save for its fish tank presentation, this is a wholly unremarkable version of Tetris."

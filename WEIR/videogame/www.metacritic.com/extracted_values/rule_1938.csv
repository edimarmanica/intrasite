"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_importtunerchallenge.html","The game design is pretty cool for a next-gen console, but the meat and potatoes of a real exciting street racer got checked at the door."

"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_beowulf.html","It's just run-of-the-mill game design. Bar the occasionally impressive combat, Beowulf doesn't have enough to make it stand out."

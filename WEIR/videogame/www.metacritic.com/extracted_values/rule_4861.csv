"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_timeshift.html","Although we've been here many times before, Timeshift is still a slick shooter with some neat ideas. [Christmas 2007, p.83]"
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_facebreaker.html","Overall, the game is a brilliant idea that was executed terribly."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_bionicleheroes.html","The game looks good, but is let down by a poor camera control system and the music is simply woeful."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_blacksitearea51.html",The game is merely another mediocre bag of wasted potential tossed out that simply begs you to lower your expectations right before diving in.

"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_spiderwickchronicles.html","Overall this is a fairly solid title, nothing awe inspiring yet nothing dismal, and unfortunately for a movie tie-in that is quite an achievement."
"/sdd/edimar/Desktop/doutorado/doutorado04/bases/WEIR/videogame/www.metacritic.com/xbox360_supermanreturnsthevideogame.html","The game has the mechanics down in the flying and running, but the combat and the game's progression just isn't up to par with where it needs to be."
